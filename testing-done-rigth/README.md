## Testing Done Right

- Type: Mid-level
- Length: 30min

## If I attend your session, what practical capability will I bring back to my team and be able to implement next week?

This talk will make your life easier, and drastically reduce the amount of time you spend debugging. You’ll learn some best practices when writing tests to keep your tests resilient and easy to understand.

## Summary

Have you done testing before? Great! Now it’s time to learn how to do it right. This talk contains the best practices and guidelines to write tests in PHP that are readable, fast, reliable, isolated, without flakiness, and more.

Get ready for a 25 min live-coding session, where I am going to write tests for a real-world application. No worries, the examples will be in PHP/Laravel, but the principles can be applied to all languages and test frameworks.

## Speaker

Salut! My name is Nuno Maduro, and I am a member of the PHP community for a long time now. Last year, I made a total of 2,562 open source contributions. And I have spoken at conferences such as ForumPHP in Paris - France, or Laravel Live India.

I have a close relationship with the Laravel community, as I have contributed to the core of the framework and created tons of open source packages for Laravel, such as Laravel Zero, Scout Extended, Collision, Larastan, and more.

I also maintain the open source API clients and integrations at Algolia, where I have to write robust, safe, and maintainable code.

Early this year, I have created a landing page for my premium video course: https://nunomaduro.com/writing-effective-php.
