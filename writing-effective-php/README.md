## Writing Effective PHP

- Type: Mid-level
- Length: 45 min or 30 min
- Project: TBD

PHP has evolved massively since its first days, and it's on the road to a full-featured language. However, at the same time, there is a lot of outdated information and libraries with poorly written code.

This talk is about writing PHP Code that is: safe, robust, maintainable, and optimized for the reader. We are going to cover a set of rules, that if you follow them; they will get you on the habit of writing code well.

Get ready for a 20 to 35 min live-coding session, where I go through practical examples. You will learn how to design classes, how to think about your API to prevent breaking changes, and discover concepts around method design, naming, error handling, and much more.
