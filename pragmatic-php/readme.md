## Pragmatic PHP

- Title: Pragmatic PHP
- Type: Mid-level
- Length: 30min/45min

## If I attend your session, what practical capability will I bring back to my team and be able to implement next week?

After this talk, you will be a better PHP developer. You will be able to approach code in a very pragmatic way, understanding when you should keep it simple.

## Summary

The difference between a junior and senior software engineer is something we call “experience” - The experience is nothing more than choosing the *right* tools/practices for the right project at the right time.

This talk is about writing PHP Code that satisfies your project needs:
- When and how to design interfaces
- When and where you should use globals
- When and how to use static interfaces
- How to define testing granularity
- And much more

Get ready for a 25 min live-coding session, where I go through practical examples that will make you understand that you don’t need to write complex code when you aren't gonna need it.

## Speaker

Salut! My name is Nuno Maduro, and I am a member of the PHP community for a long time now. Last year, I made a total of 2,562 open source contributions. And I have spoken at conferences such as PHP Serbia, Laracon EU, ForumPHP France, or Laravel Live India.

I have a close relationship with the Laravel community, as I have contributed to the core of the framework. I also have created tons of open source packages such as PHP Insights, Laravel Zero, Scout Extended, Collision, Larastan, and more.

I also maintain the open source API clients and integrations at Algolia, where I have to write robust, safe, and maintainable code.

Early this year, I have launched my premium video course: https://nunomaduro.com/writing-effective-php.
