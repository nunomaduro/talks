## Effective PHP

- Type: Mid-level
- Length: 45 min or 30 min
- Project: TBD

PHP has evolved massively since its first days, and it's on the road to a
full-featured language. However, at the same time, there is a lot of outdated information and libraries with poorly written code.

This talk is about writing PHP Code that is: safe, robust, maintainable, and optimized for the reader. We are going to cover a set of rules, that if you
follow them; they will get you on the habit of writing code well.

Get ready for a 20 min/35 min live-coding session where rules will be illustrated with a real practical example. You will learn how to design classes, re-thinking about their public API preventing breaking changes. You will also discover concepts about methods design and variables
naming, exceptions, and more about general programming.
