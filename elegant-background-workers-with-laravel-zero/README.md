# Elegant Background Workers with Laravel Zero

- Type: Entry level
- Project: [Laravel Zero](https://github.com/laravel-zero/laravel-zero)

Queues allow you to defer the processing of a time-consuming task, such as sending an e-mail, until a later time which drastically speeds up web requests to your application.

In this talk, we will be using Laravel Zero, a micro-framework that leverages an unofficial and customized version of Laravel to provide an elegant starting point for your background workers.

Laravel Zero is lightweight and modular micro-framework for developing fast and powerful console applications and makes it super easy and enjoyable to do background processing in PHP.

Behind the scenes, Laravel Zero uses the Laravel Queue component, that provides a unified API across a variety of different queue backends, such as Beanstalk, Amazon SQS, Redis, or even a relational database.

This talk will include a 20 min live-coding session, where you will learn how to leverage Laravel Zero to make background workers with a real practical example.

After this talk, youâ€™ll be able to deliver console apps at warp speed. Your console app can be used for any recurring task, such as cronjobs, imports, or other batch jobs.
