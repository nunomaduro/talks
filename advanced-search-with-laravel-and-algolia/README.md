## Advanced search with Laravel and Algolia

- Type: Mid-level
- Length: 30min

## If I attend your session, what practical capability will I bring back to my team and be able to implement next week?

After this talk, you will able to build, optimize and personalize search for your users. 

Quick side note, you can use Algolia's basic community plan. It's free.

## Summary

If you’re interested in having a highly relevant search experience on your website, you're in luck. In this talk, Nuno Maduro, an employee of Algolia, will show you how to build a search experience that your users will love.

Together, we’ll build a Laravel Application from scratch, and use Laravel Scout as a starting point to cover all necessary installation steps, from indexing your models to searching.

Then, you’ll get a taste of Algolia’s unique features with its Scout Extended, such as zero-downtime reimports and site-wide search among multiple models with Aggregators.

Finally, we are going to drive the brand new Vue InstantSearch v2, building a find-as-you-type blazing-fast search experience.

## Speaker

Salut! My name is Nuno Maduro, and I am a member of the PHP community for a long time now. Last year, I made a total of 2,562 open source contributions. And I have spoken at conferences such as ForumPHP in Paris - France, or Laravel Live India.

I have a close relationship with the Laravel community, as I have contributed to the core of the framework and created tons of open source packages for Laravel, such as Laravel Zero, Scout Extended, Collision, Larastan, and more.

I also maintain the open source API clients and integrations at Algolia, where I have to write robust, safe, and maintainable code.

Early this year, I have launched my premium video course: https://nunomaduro.com/writing-effective-php.
