While it's fun to write little one-off utility scripts, sometimes you need to write real console apps. One that takes arguments and plays nicely with UNIX conventions for input, output or error reporting.

In this talk, we will be using Laravel Zero, a micro-framework that leverages an unofficial and customized version of Laravel to provide an elegant starting point for your console app.

You’ll learn about the philosophies and ideas behind the framework. We’ll also cover the most important features of Laravel Zero, such as the optional installation of Laravel Eloquent, the usage of Laravel Scheduler or the integration with Collision.

This talk will include a 20 min live-coding session, where you will learn how to leverage Laravel Zero to make console apps with a real practical example.

After this talk, you’ll be able to deliver console apps at warp speed. Your console app can be used for any recurring task, such as cronjobs, imports, or other batch jobs. You will be able to leverage Laravel Zero, a micro-framework built on top of Laravel components, to use your favorite features of Laravel to build a structured an elegant command line app.
